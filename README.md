Milestone-Project-1
This will be my first attempt at making a web game using only html css and javascript.

First game attempt will be the snake game.
Pretty simple logic. We use the arrow keys to move the snake on the x and y axis. Every time the snake eats it will continue to grow.
I will be using canvas.

We start with a board that will be 20x20 and the block size will be 25.
